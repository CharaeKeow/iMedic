# ðŸ‘“ PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT
## PROJECT MANAGEMENT LIFE CYCLE 

The Gantt Chart has been used to implement the project management life cycle, which is particularly beneficial for planning and scheduling work. Every team member has been allocated tasks in a Gantt Chart at each stage of the lifecycle to help us estimate how long each activity should take, calculate the resources required, and organise the sequence in which the activities should be completed.

The Gantt chart is as follows:

The work breakdown structure (WBS) chart has been used to display the structure of a project, demonstrating how the project is broken down into summary and detail levels:

## Risk Identification Chart

| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
| :---         |     :---:      |          :---: |          :--:  |
| Quality | The system incorrectly predicts the outcome of the medical check-up. | The input criteria do not match the return results, as we will see. During the testing process, this risk might be discovered. | Express opinions to the Quality Manager to ensure that the predictions are always correct.|
| Cost | The project's cost exceeds the budgeted amount. | If the budget has not been effectively prepared, the project cost will rise. This risk will be present, particularly throughout the execution or deployment of the project. | Keep a constant eye on the progress, especially when it comes to the budget. Make sure the explanation on the budget summary is correct. |
| Time | The project would not be finished on time. | Unexpected issues arise, particularly risks that we didn't expect. Furthermore, the project may be delayed as a result of a member's failure to adhere to the schedule. | Have a weekly meeting with members so that we can track each member's development. Furthermore, if other members are unable to perform the task, we can assist them by providing suggestions and methods for resolving the issue. |
