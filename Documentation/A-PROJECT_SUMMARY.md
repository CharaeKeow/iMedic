### **üìù Project Summary**

Wellness Clinic is a health facility that focuses mostly on outpatient care. Aside from that, this clinic offers a full medical checkup service, and the doctors discovered that many of their patients had diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and liver disease. Doctors recognize that traditional comprehensive medical checkups take longer time period to produce results, and that disease can progress to a critical stage before the results are received. However, if the doctor can detect the stage early on, the condition can be treated as quickly as possible before it progresses. A speedier and more accurate medical checkup service, depending on the situation, could assist the doctor in taking action to treat the disease immediately. Furthermore, because the doctor does not employ high-tech devices or techniques to cure the patients, the cost of curing the patients will be reduced.

To diagnose diseases, we used an Artificial Intelligence technology called machine learning in our project. This study focuses mostly on common clinic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and liver disease. The major goal of this project is to provide a quick and concise medical checkup report to the doctor by entering a variety of patient data into a system that can identify patients suffering from any of the diseases listed above. This project is the first step in creating a quick, accurate, and concise medical check-up report in a matter of minutes.

### **üß† Objectives**
- To develop a machine learning model that predicts the common diseases.
- To generate a mini medical checkup report in shorter time period.
- To develop a website that Doctor able to interact.
